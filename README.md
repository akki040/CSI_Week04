Titanic Survival Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📁 Project Files
EDA_Titanic_Survival_Analysis.py – Python script with the complete EDA workflow in a script format.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).ipynb – Jupyter Notebook version of the same code, formatted for interactive, visual exploration.

titanic_cleaned.csv – Cleaned Titanic dataset with missing values imputed and additional features created.

Note: Both .py and .ipynb files contain the same analysis and code, only differing in format — one is script-based, the other notebook-style.

📌 Project Description
This project performs detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to identify patterns in survival rates based on demographics, class, fare, and more. It includes visualization, feature engineering, and summary insights.

🔍 Objectives
Explore variable distributions

Handle missing values using machine learning techniques

Analyze survival by demographic and socioeconomic factors

Create new features such as age groups and family size

Visualize data with histograms, box plots, and heatmaps

📊 Key Insights
Women and children had higher survival rates

1st-class passengers were more likely to survive

Passengers from Cherbourg (C) had the best survival chances

Small families survived more often than individuals or large families

🧪 Requirements
Python 3.7+

pandas

numpy

seaborn

matplotlib

scikit-learn
